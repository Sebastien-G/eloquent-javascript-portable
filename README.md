# eloquent-javascript-portable

A portable, offline-compatible of [__*Eloquent JavaScript*__ by **Marijn Haverbeke**](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).

This version is a repackaged version of the HTML pages, complete with **images** and **code sandbox* (including the **exercise solutions**) intended for offline use.

Once downloaded locally, it should work exactly like the online version, but will not require an Internet connection.
The external links, obviously, will only be reachable when you have an Internet connection.

Some minor modifications have been applied to the main stylesheet to increase to size of the main navigation (especially on the bottom one).
Indeed the main application for the version was for use on a tablet, so I wanted the buttons to be easier to use with a touchscreen.
